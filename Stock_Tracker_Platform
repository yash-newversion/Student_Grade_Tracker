This is a solid implementation of a Stock Trading Platform using Java. It covers the core requirements of your task, specifically utilizing OOP principles (Encapsulation and Abstraction) and File I/O for data persistence.

Here is a comprehensive description you can use for your GitHub README.md or repository description.

Stock Trading Platform (Java)
A console-based stock trading simulation that allows users to register, trade stocks in real-time, and manage their investment portfolios. This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File I/O in Java to create a persistent financial application.

🚀 Features
Market Management: Administrators can enlist new stocks with unique symbols, company names, prices, and available quantities.

User Registration: Users can create profiles with a starting cash balance.

Trading Engine:

Buy Stocks: Automatically checks for sufficient market liquidity and user balance.

Sell Stocks: Validates user ownership before processing the sale and returning funds to the balance.

Portfolio Tracking: Real-time view of current stock holdings and remaining cash balance.

Transaction History: Detailed logs of every buy/sell action, including timestamps (via LocalDateTime).

Data Persistence:

users.txt and stocks.txt store global market data.

Individual portfolio_[username].txt and transactions_[username].txt files ensure user data is saved even after the program exits.

🏗️ Architecture (OOP Design)
The project is structured into five core classes to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

Main.java: The entry point containing the command-line interface and menu logic.

Market.java: Acts as the controller, managing the collection of stocks and users, and coordinating transactions.

User.java: Handles individual account logic, including portfolio updates and personal file I/O.

Stock.java: Represents a financial instrument with attributes like price and market availability.

Transaction.java: An immutable-style record of a specific trade event
